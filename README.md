# Natural Zoom Gesture Interaction on Frugal Devices for AR Application

## ABSTARCT
In air-gesture based Natural interaction has important role in human-computer interface. it Provides significant part in non verbal communication, hand gestures are playing vital role in our dailylife. Gesture Recognition has a wide area of application including human machine interaction, sign language, immersive game technology etc. However, many applications have been proposed
to incorporate with additional wearable sensors and some specific training for each user may be required. These limitations make it inconvenience for using in the real world. This paper presents novel one-handed gesture based interaction for zoom in/out manipulation of FOV, which is fast and easy to implement without using any additional. The manipulation of zoom command with natural gesture is to pinch or to stretch fingers, like on touch-devices. The goal of this research is to extending the interaction space around mobile devices for augmented reality on Cardboard, i.e. applications where users
look at the live image of the devices video camera.The technique uses only the RGB camera now commonplace on off-the-shelf mo-
bile devices. Our algorithm robustly recognizes Zoom in/out in-air gestures, supporting user variation, and varying lighting conditions. We demonstrate that our algorithm runs in real-time on unmodified mobile devices, including resource-constrained Smartphones. Finally, we report results from preliminary user evaluations, discuss advantages and limitations and conclude with directions for future work.
